Hi.

Sorry if you don't like any of the below. Haters gonna hate. As Kimya says though,
"Remember that I love you."

This is code toward the "word" release of 
Programming Structure for Language and Culture or PSLC.

The goal of PSLC is not to carry a conversation, like touring machines 
spear-headed by markov chain random-acts-of-violence. The goal of PSLC is 
to try to take the role of the reader. 

Word Release Milestones:
1. get Dictionary, parts of speach dfn, spelling
2. make meaning/root/pos graphs for each word.

stuffs to do:
Find source. Experiment w/lookup times, create stores for all types of data
* Buy/Torrent Dictionary?
* Maybe Merriam Webster would sell me a DB to use?
* I should probably do all of these releases in school child style of 
  all at the same time. Word Release:::Kindergarten. 

TEMPLATES wtf templates. like just look at the source of any wiktionary page
they. are. everywhere. That's probably my next target. 

SPEECH there is a lot of pronunciation items here. I should hook up some
Phoneme correlations up in here. Then PSLC could be a reader and a listener.

I've been reading some about phonemes (I know pho-nee-mees is wrong but it 
would be so amusing) and how certain dialects move them/correlate them 
differently. It sounds completely reasonable to want to build a mathematical 
model in this area. 

HANDWRITING so my idea for handwriting is to mix coding theory, bezier-curves,
and hand muscle structure limited range of motion modeling to come up with a
less statistical model of how handwriting gets recognized. 

Other Releases half-scheduled:

Emotional Release
========= =======
-- WARNING: the following is a raw transcription from my initial notes.

What its the participle?
What are stories?
What's on your mind?
How are you feeling?
Emotions. Associations. "Emotionally Kant's 'Proper'" -- draw curves,
derivatives ala Kurt Vonnegut graphs.
K_n = [n_0, n_1, n_2, \dots, n_\Aleph]
each with a type of emotion/judgment. How each have correlated/ differ over 
time... They probably reset as time passes.

emo milestones:
1. Infer emotions.
2. Emo over time. 


GRAMMAR RELEASE
======= =======
What are all the ways this sentence can be structured?

INDUCTION/DEDUCTION RELEASE
========= ========= =======

INSTRUCTION RELEASE
=========== =======

RHETORIC RELEASE
======== =======
1. Identify Ethos, Pathos, Logos

REPHASE RELEASE
======= =======
What is the internal language of PSLC?
What does PSLC think in? how do we translate
to PSLC?








I just found this after I wrote my code. But this is partly to learn new tech
and partly to have fun doing it.
